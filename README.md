# bloom-parse-server

This is the database backend for bloom-library.org, using the [parse-server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server) module.

Here is the full [Parse Server guide](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server/wiki/Parse-Server-Guide).

### Set Up For Local Development

1. Make sure you have at least Node 4.3.

    `node --version`
1. Clone this repo and go into its directory, and install or update the dependencies:

    `npm install`

1. Install mongodb server

1. Give mongodb a blank directory to work with, and run it:

    `mongod.exe --dbpath c:\temp\mongodata`

1. Start up this server:

    `npm start`

    Or, to debug, open bloom-parse-server in vscode, F5 (Debug: Launch via NPM). Note that this sets the masterid to "123", via an environment variable.

1. Setup or update the mongodb Schema

    ```
    curl -X POST -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: myAppId" -H "X-Parse-Master-Key: 123" -d "{}" http://localhost:1337/parse/functions/setupTables
    ```
    You should get

    `{"result":"SetupTables ran to completion."}`

    and see the tables in the dashboard.

1. Run Parse Dashboard:

    Go to [http://localhost:1337/dashboard](http://localhost:1337/dashboard)

    You will be required to log in. The username is the appId ('myAppId'), and the password is the masterKey ('123').

### Dashboard

See above for setting up the dashboard locally.

Public dashboards:

* Production: [http://parsedashboard.bloomlibrary.org](http://parsedashboard.bloomlibrary.org)        
* Development: [http://dev.parsedashboard.bloomlibrary.org](http://dev.parsedashboard.bloomlibrary.org)

You will be required to log in. The username is the appId, and the password is the masterKey.

### Sample Queries

```
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: myAppId" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' \
  http://localhost:1337/parse/functions/hello
```

### Azure Setup

We are running three different services:

* bloom-parse-server-unittest
* bloom-parse-server-develop
* bloom-parse-server-production

Each is backed by a single mongodb at mlab.com. This is how they were made:

1. Create the mongodb on mlab.com, making sure to select Azure and the same datacenter. Failing to do this increases response times by 3x.
2. In Azure, create a new "Web App" App Service
3. In Azure:App Service:Application Settings:App Settings, create these settings:

    DATABASE_URI mongodb://account:password@something.com:port/database

    APP_ID you make this up.

    MASTER_KEY you make this up

    SERVER_URL http://[azure app service name].azurewebsites.net/parse

    Note: Don't leave off that /parse in the SERVER_URL!

    REST API: parse.com used this (not clear what the actual environment variable would be) but as far as I can tell, the open source Parse-Server does not.

4. In Azure:App Service:Deployment Options, point it at this github repository,
with the appropriate branch. A few minutes later, parse-server will be running. Note that Azure apparently does the `npm install` automatically, as needed.
Not also that it automatically redepoys when github notifies it of a checkin on the branch it is watching.

    TODO: Set up Deployment "Slots".

5. We never touch the schema using the Parse Dashboard or letting queries automagically add clases or fields.
Instead, we set up the schema using a Cloud Code function `setupTables`.
If you haven't set up the database already, follow instructions shown above under "Setup or update the mongodb Schema".
Use Azure:App Service:Log stream to monitor progress.
Note: During one setup, I found this can be flaky, perhaps becuase I jumped the gun.
So instead I did the curl post for `functions/testDB`, which worked.
Then I tried `functions/setupTables` again, and this time it worked.

6. TODO: Backup, Logging setup.
